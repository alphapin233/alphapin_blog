  chomp is a game which is played with two players.
  
  Each player will take turns taking chocolate from a m*n grid.
  When a piece of chocolate is selected, all the pieces below and to the right of the piece will also be removed.
  Unfortunately,until now there is not a definitive winning choice for any random size of the whole piece.
